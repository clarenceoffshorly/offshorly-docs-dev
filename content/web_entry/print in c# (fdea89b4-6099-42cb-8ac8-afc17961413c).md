# Print in C#

This is how to print in C#:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

In C#, we use the `Console.WriteLine()` method to print text to the console. This method is part of the `System` namespace, which is why we include `using System;` at the beginning of our code.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `using System;` - This line imports the System namespace, which contains the Console class.
2. `class Program` - This defines the main class of our program.
3. `static void Main()` - This is the entry point of our C# program.
4. `Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");` - This line prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console.

You can replace "Hello, World!" with any text you want to print.
