# Printing in COBOL

COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) provides several ways to output data to the console or a file. This guide demonstrates how to use the `DISPLAY` statement for printing in COBOL.

## Basic DISPLAY Statement

The `DISPLAY` statement is used to output data to the console. Here's a simple example:

```cobol
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. HELLO-WORLD.
ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
DATA DIVISION.
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    DISPLAY "Hello, World!".
    STOP RUN.
```

This program will output "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Displaying Variables

You can also display the contents of variables:

```cobol
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. DISPLAY-VARIABLES.
ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
DATA DIVISION.
WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
01 WS-NAME PIC X(20) VALUE "John Doe".
01 WS-AGE PIC 9(3) VALUE 30.
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    DISPLAY "Name: " WS-NAME.
    DISPLAY "Age: " WS-AGE.
    STOP RUN.
```

This program defines two variables (WS-NAME and WS-AGE) and displays their values.

## Formatting Output

To format output, you can use the `UPON CONSOLE` phrase and combine multiple items:

```cobol
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. FORMATTED-OUTPUT.
ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
DATA DIVISION.
WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
01 WS-TOTAL PIC 9(5)V99 VALUE 1234.56.
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    DISPLAY "Total: $" WS-TOTAL UPON CONSOLE.
    STOP RUN.
```

This program demonstrates how to format and display a numeric value with a currency symbol.

## Using LINE and COLUMN Phrases

For more precise positioning of output, use the `LINE` and `COLUMN` phrases:

```cobol
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. POSITIONED-OUTPUT.
ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
DATA DIVISION.
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    DISPLAY "Header" LINE 1 COLUMN 10.
    DISPLAY "Body" LINE 3 COLUMN 5.
    DISPLAY "Footer" LINE 10 COLUMN 1.
    STOP RUN.
```

This program shows how to position text at specific locations on the screen using LINE and COLUMN phrases.

Remember that the exact behavior of these statements may vary depending on your COBOL compiler and environment. Always refer to your specific COBOL implementation's documentation for detailed information on printing and output formatting.
