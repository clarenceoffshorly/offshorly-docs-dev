# This is a documentation on how to print

This document provides a simple guide on how to print in Python.

You'll learn how to print in Python using a basic function.

## Printing in Python

```python
# Function to print a greeting
def print_greeting():
    print("Hello, World!")

# Example usage
print_greeting()
```

In this example, we define a function called `print_greeting()` that uses Python's built-in `print()` function to output the string "Hello, World!" to the console. You can call this function whenever you want to display this greeting.

To use this in your own code, simply copy the function definition and call it as shown in the example usage.
