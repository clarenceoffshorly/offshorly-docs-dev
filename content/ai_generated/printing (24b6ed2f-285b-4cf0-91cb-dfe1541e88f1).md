# This is a documentation on how to print

This document provides a simple guide on how to print in Python, including a basic function example.

## Printing in Python

Printing in Python is a fundamental operation that allows you to output text or variables to the console. Here's a simple example of how to create a function that prints a message:

```python
def print_hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")

# Call the function
print_hello_world()
```

In this example, we define a function called `print_hello_world()` that uses the `print()` function to output the string "Hello, World!" to the console. To execute this function, you simply need to call it in your code.
