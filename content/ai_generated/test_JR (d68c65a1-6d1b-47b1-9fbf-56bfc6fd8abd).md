# Test JR MD

This markdown file contains a simple Python script that prints 'Hello World by JR' to the console.

This is only for testing the repository.

```python
# Print a greeting message
print("Hello World by JR")
```

## How it works

1. The script uses the `print()` function to output a string.
2. The string "Hello World by JR" is passed as an argument to the `print()` function.
3. When executed, this script will display the message "Hello World by JR" in the console.
