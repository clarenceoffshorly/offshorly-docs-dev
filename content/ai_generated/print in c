# Print in C#

This markdown file demonstrates how to print in C#.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

In C#, we use the `Console.WriteLine()` method to print text to the console. This method automatically adds a newline character at the end of the output.

For printing without a newline, you can use `Console.Write()` instead:

```csharp
Console.Write("Hello, ");
Console.Write("World!");
```

This will output "Hello, World!" on a single line.
