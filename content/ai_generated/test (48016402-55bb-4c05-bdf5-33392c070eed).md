# Array Sum Function

This markdown file contains a JavaScript function that calculates the sum of elements in an array.

```javascript
function sumArray(arr) {
  let sum = 0;
  
  // Iterate through the array and add each element to the sum
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    sum += arr[i];
  }
  
  return sum;
}
```

## Function Explanation

The `sumArray` function takes an array `arr` as input and returns the sum of all its elements. Here's how it works:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
2. Iterate through each element of the array using a single loop.
3. Add each element to the `sum` variable.
4. Return the final sum.

This implementation is more efficient than the original nested loop approach, as it has a time complexity of O(n) instead of O(n^2).
