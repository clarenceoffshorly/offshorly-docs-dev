# Will Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you.

You can use AWS Lambda to extend other AWS services with custom logic, or create your own back-end services that operate at AWS scale, performance, and security.

## Features

- **Zero administration**: No need to worry about server provisioning, monitoring, maintenance, scaling, or patching.
- **Continuous scaling**: Automatically scales your application by running code in response to each trigger.
- **Subsecond metering**: Pay only for the compute time you consume.
- **Integrated security model**: Automatically execute code in response to HTTP requests via Amazon API Gateway, or expose your code as a RESTful API.
- **Integrated monitoring**: Monitor your functions in near real-time using Amazon CloudWatch.
- **Integrated logging**: Monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize your functions using AWS CloudTrail and AWS CloudWatch Logs.
- **Integrated development environment**: Develop and test your functions locally using the AWS SAM CLI or the AWS Toolkit.
