# Security Testing

Security testing is a process intended to reveal flaws in the security mechanisms of an information system that protect data and maintain functionality as intended.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    // printf() displays the string inside quotation
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```
