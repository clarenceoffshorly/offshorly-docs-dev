# COBOL Print Statement Guide #

This guide demonstrates how to use the PRINT statement in COBOL to output data. COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments.

## Basic PRINT Statement ##

In COBOL, the PRINT statement is not a standard command. Instead, you typically use the DISPLAY statement to output data to the console or a file. Here's a basic example:

```cobol
DISPLAY "Hello, World!".
```

## Printing Variables ##

To print the value of a variable, you can include it in the DISPLAY statement:

```cobol
01 WS-NAME PIC X(20) VALUE "John Doe".
DISPLAY "Name: " WS-NAME.
```

## Formatting Output ##

For more formatted output, you can use the WRITE statement to write to a file or printer:

```cobol
FD  PRINT-FILE
    RECORD CONTAINS 132 CHARACTERS
    LABEL RECORDS ARE OMITTED.
01  PRINT-LINE PIC X(132).

PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    OPEN OUTPUT PRINT-FILE.
    MOVE "Hello, World!" TO PRINT-LINE.
    WRITE PRINT-LINE AFTER ADVANCING 1 LINE.
    CLOSE PRINT-FILE.
```

## Using DISPLAY WITH ##

Some COBOL compilers support the DISPLAY WITH statement for more control over output:

```cobol
DISPLAY "Enter your name: " WITH NO ADVANCING.
ACCEPT WS-NAME.
DISPLAY "Hello, " WS-NAME "!".
```

Remember that COBOL syntax can vary slightly between different compilers and versions. Always consult your specific COBOL implementation's documentation for the most accurate information.
