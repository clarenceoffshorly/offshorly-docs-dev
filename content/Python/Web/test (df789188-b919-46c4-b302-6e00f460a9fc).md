# For Loop in Python #

This markdown file demonstrates the usage of a for loop in Python.

## Basic For Loop ##

Here's a simple example of a for loop in Python:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Iteration {i}")
```

This loop will iterate 5 times, printing the iteration number each time.

## Explanation ##

1. The `range(5)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4.
2. The loop variable `i` takes on each value in this sequence.
3. The `print()` function is called in each iteration, displaying the current value of `i`.

## Use Cases ##

For loops are commonly used in Python for:

- Iterating over sequences (lists, tuples, strings)
- Performing a task a specific number of times
- Traversing data structures

Remember to properly indent the code inside the loop to ensure correct execution.
