# Python Print Statement #

This markdown demonstrates a simple Python print statement.

```python
print("THIS IS PYTHON")
```

This code will output the string "THIS IS PYTHON" to the console when executed.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. The `print()` function is a built-in Python function used to display output.
2. Inside the parentheses, we have a string literal "THIS IS PYTHON".
3. When the code is run, Python will evaluate the `print()` function and display the string on the console.

This simple example showcases the basic syntax of Python's print statement and how it can be used to output text.
