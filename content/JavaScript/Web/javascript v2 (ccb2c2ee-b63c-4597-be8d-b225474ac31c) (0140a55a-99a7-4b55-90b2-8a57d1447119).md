# Code Example #

This markdown file contains a simple JavaScript code snippet that logs a message to the console.

```javascript
console.log("THIS IS V2");
```

This code will output the string "THIS IS V2" to the console when executed.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. `console.log()` is a built-in JavaScript function used for debugging and logging information.
2. The string "THIS IS V2" is passed as an argument to the `console.log()` function.
3. When this code is run in a JavaScript environment (like a browser's console or Node.js), it will print the message "THIS IS V2" to the console.

This simple example demonstrates basic output in JavaScript, which is often used for debugging or providing status updates during program execution.
