# JavaScript Console Log Example #

This markdown demonstrates a simple JavaScript console log statement.

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

This code snippet prints "Hello World!" to the console when executed in a JavaScript environment.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. `console.log()` is a built-in JavaScript function used for outputting messages to the console.
2. The string "Hello World!" is passed as an argument to the `console.log()` function.
3. When this code is run, it will display the message "Hello World!" in the console of the JavaScript environment (e.g., browser developer tools or Node.js terminal).

This simple example is often used as a first step in learning JavaScript or testing if a JavaScript environment is set up correctly.
