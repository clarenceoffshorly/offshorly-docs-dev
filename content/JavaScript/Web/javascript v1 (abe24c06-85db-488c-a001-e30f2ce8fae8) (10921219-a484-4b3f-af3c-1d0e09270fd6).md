# Code Example #

This markdown file contains a simple JavaScript code snippet that logs a message to the console.

```javascript
console.log("THIS IS V1");
```

This code will output the string "THIS IS V1" to the console when executed.

Here's a brief explanation of how the code works:

1. The `console.log()` function is a built-in JavaScript method used for debugging and logging information.
2. It takes one or more arguments and prints them to the console.
3. In this case, we're passing a single string argument: "THIS IS V1".
4. When the code runs, it will display this message in the console of the browser's developer tools or in the terminal if running in a Node.js environment.

This simple example demonstrates basic output in JavaScript, which is often used for debugging or providing status updates during program execution.
