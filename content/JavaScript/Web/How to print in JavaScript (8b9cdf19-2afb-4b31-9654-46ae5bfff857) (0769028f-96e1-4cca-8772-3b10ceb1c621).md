# JavaScript Console Log Example #

This markdown demonstrates a simple JavaScript console log statement.

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

This code snippet prints "Hello World!" to the console when executed in a JavaScript environment.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. `console.log()` is a built-in JavaScript function used for debugging and logging information.
2. The string "Hello World!" is passed as an argument to the `console.log()` function.
3. When this code runs, it will output the text "Hello World!" to the console.

This example is often used as a simple introduction to JavaScript programming and to verify that your JavaScript environment is set up correctly.
